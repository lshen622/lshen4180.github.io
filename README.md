## Introduction
Welcome to our innovative version of the classic Whack-A-Mole game, reimagined with modern technology. This game offers a unique twist by incorporating an ultrasonic sensor and an MPR121 touchpad to provide a more interactive and engaging experience. 

In this game, players use the touchpad to select their desired difficulty level and to whack the moles that appear on the screen. The ultrasonic sensor adds an extra layer of interactivity, allowing players to use hand gestures to hit the moles, making the game more dynamic and physically engaging.

Our Whack-A-Mole game is not only entertaining but also demonstrates the potential of integrating various sensors and inputs into traditional gaming formats. It serves as an excellent example of how technology can be used to enhance the gaming experience, making it more immersive and enjoyable for players of all ages.
